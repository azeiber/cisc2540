# Godot Lab 1: 2D Ocean Project

## Description
This project is a simple 2D ocean environment built using the Godot engine. It includes:
- A main scene that hosts the ocean itself.
- Two different sprites: a shark and a seahorse.
- Multiple instances of fish to create a diverse ocean habitat.

## Things I Learned:
- Managing multiple sprites and positioning them in the scene.

## Questions:
- How are the scenes different from nodes, when working with the engine it can sometimes be a little confusing.
